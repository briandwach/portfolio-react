## Description

This is a web development portfolio built as a single page web application using React.  

- This application was built with Vite in a Node.js environment.  
- It is a single page application using the [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) package to enable page history navigation.
- It utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) for stylings.  
- In addition, the page uses the [vite-plugin-pwa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-pwa/v/0.9.1) to register a service worker to cache static assets for better performance.
- Projects can be easily updated via an exported object in the data folder directory.  Screenshots of the example application should have a resolution of 764x430.
- With no back end, the contact form is functional by using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
